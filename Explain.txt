Constructive criticism is feedback given to someone with the intention of helping them improve their skills, behavior, or performance in a positive and constructive way. 
It focuses on specific actions, behaviors, or outcomes rather than on the individual as a person. Constructive criticism is meant to be helpful, supportive, and respectful, and is intended to encourage growth and development rather than to criticize or put down.
