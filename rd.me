In this implementation, the Person class is the base class that represents a person.
The Pharmacist class and Cashier class extend the Person class and represent a pharmacist and a cashier respectively. 
The Employee class extends the Person class and represents an employee. 
The Manager class extends the Employee class and represents a manager.

The Pharmacist class has a writePrescription() method that writes a prescription for a patient. 
The Cashier class has collectCash() and returnCash() methods that collect cash and return cash to the customer respectively. 
The Manager class has manageEmployees(), workAsCashier(), and workAsPharmacist() methods that manage employees, work as a cashier, and work as a pharmacist respectively.

Finally, we create objects of the classes and call the methods as needed.
